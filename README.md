# Redux store

This is the first application, where I've practiced with Redux. It's a simple book store
 with two pages: main (home) page and cart page. On this site you can: add book to cart, 
 increase/decrease amount of books in cart, delete book from the cart. And you can see 
total order price and books count in the header. For this project, I've used mock data, 
but you can easily implement work with real server here.

I have practiced with creating store, reducers, action creators and my own store 
enhancers (they wasn't included in the final version of the project), middleware 
(in particular with thunk middleware). And also have trained with react-redux 
library (Provider, connect).
